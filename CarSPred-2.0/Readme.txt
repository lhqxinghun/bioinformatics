Introduction:
1.The software CarSPred 2.0 could be used to identify carbonylation sites of query human protein sequences.
2.The software consists of four modules which are devoted to K, R, T and P carbonylation site prediction separately.
3.It receives protein sequences or file in FASTA format as input.
4.For output result, list and file are optional and the annotations will clearly indicate the precise location and probability of putative carbonylation site in the sequence.
5.The software is in 'CarSPred' folder. Datasets of carbonylated protein and sample sequences of carbonylation site are in 'Datasets' folder.

Datasets available on the site:
1.Sample sequences of human carbonylation in 'Datasets' folder
'H-carbonprotein.xlsx'	 - 230 carbonylated proteins of human					13.1KB
'H-traincarbonpos-K.fsa' - 266 sequences of K positive training samples of human		13.3KB
'H-traincarbonpos-R.fsa' - 119 sequences of R positive training samples of human    		6.2KB  
'H-traincarbonpos-T.fsa' - 116 sequences of T positive training samples of human    		5.8KB  
'H-traincarbonpos-P.fsa' - 114 sequences of P positive training samples of human    		5.7KB
