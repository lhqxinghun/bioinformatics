Introduction:
1.The software CarSPred 3.0 could be used to identify carbonylation sites of query yeast protein sequences.
2.The software consists of four modules which are devoted to K, R, T and P carbonylation site prediction separately.
3.It receives protein sequences or file in FASTA format as input.
4.For output result, list and file are optional and the annotations will clearly indicate the precise location and probability of putative carbonylation site in the sequence.
5.The software is in 'CarSPred' folder. Datasets of carbonylated proteins and sample sequences for carbonylation sites are in 'Datasets' folder.

Datasets available on the site:
1.Sample sequences of yeast carbonylation sites in 'Datasets' folder
'Y-traincarbonprotein.fsa' 	- 216 carbonylated proteins of yeast			167.0KB
