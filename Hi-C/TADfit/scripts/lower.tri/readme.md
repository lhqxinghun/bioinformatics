# Lower.tri

To visualize the predicted IFs and original IFs in one heatmap (with predicted values in the lower triangle), users need to restore the temporay file p.out an y.out to the out folder. p.out restores the predicted IFs in each iteration and repeat during the solving process. y.out restores the original IFs of each replicate.

To Restore these two files in out folder, users should open the R project file in Rstudio and call the function calltad instead of using function in the installed package
